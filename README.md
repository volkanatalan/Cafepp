** UNDER DEVELOPMENT **

Forget about the paper restaurant menus. They are old, big and unchangable. With Cafepp it is easier to take orders from your customers and deliver them to cook. Make changes on your menu any time you want. Add/remove products, write explanation about them, add images as much as you want and calculate their calories.
